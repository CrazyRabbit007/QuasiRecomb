This population, shaped by the combination of\r\ngenetic change and selection, is called quasispecies. Genetic change\r\nis due to both point mutations and recombination events. We present a\r\njumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral\r\nquasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next\r\ngeneration sequencing data. We offer an implementation of the\r\nEM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model\r\nparameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains\r\nin the quasispecies. The model is validated on simulated data, showing\r\nthe advantage of explicitly taking the recombination process into\r\naccount, and tested by applying to reads obtained from experimental \r\nHIV samples.\r\n\r\n#CONTENT:\r\nThis java command line application is a toolbox, combining all necessary\r\nsteps to infer a viral quasispecies from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.\r\n\r\n#PREREQUISITES TO RUN:\r\n - JDK 7 (http://jdk7.java.net/)\r\n - Get latest version: https://github.com/armintoepfer/QuasiRecomb/downloads\r\n\r\n#RUN:\r\n`java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignedReads.fasta`\r\n\r\n The reconstructed quasispecies.fasta will be saved in the working directory.\r\n\r\n#USE / SHOW HELP:\r\n java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar\r\n\r\n#USE fixed number of generators\r\n java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignedReads.fasta -K 2\r\n\r\n#CONTACT:\r\n Armin TÃ¶pfer\r\n armin.toepfer (at) gmail.com\r\n http://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/people/toepfera\r\n\r\n\r\n#PREREQUISITES COMPILE (only for dev):\r\n - Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/)\r\n\r\n#INSTALL (only for dev):\r\n cd QuasiRecomb\r\n mvn clean package\r\n java -jar QuasiRecomb/target/QuasiRecomb.jar --help\r\n\r\n#LICENSE:\r\n GNU GPLv3 http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0"}
