# QuasiRecomb
RNA viruses are present in a single host as a population of different
but related strains. This population, shaped by the combination of
genetic change and selection, is called quasispecies. Genetic change
is due to both point mutations and recombination events. We present a
jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral
quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next
generation sequencing data. We offer an implementation of the
EM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model
parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains
in the quasispecies. The model is validated on simulated data, showing
the advantage of explicitly taking the recombination process into
account, and validated on experimental HIV samples.

#### CONTENT:
This java command line application is a toolbox, combining all necessary
steps to infer a viral quasispecies from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.

#### PREREQUISITES TO RUN:
 - JDK 7 (http://jdk7.java.net/)

## RUN:
#### Local reconstruction
 `java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignedReads.fasta`
 Reads need to be aligned, therefore it is only useful for local reconstruction.

#### Global reconstruction
 `java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignment.bam -global`
  In this case, all insertions will be omitted, but deletions are preserved.

### Use fixed number of generators
 `java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignedReads.fasta -K 2`
 
 

### Use backward pruning to get better initialization (slower)
 `java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar -i alignedReads.fasta -prune`

### Output
 The reconstructed quasispecies.fasta will be saved in the working directory.

### Help:
 Further help can be showed by running without additional parameters:
  `java -jar QuasiRecomb.jar`
