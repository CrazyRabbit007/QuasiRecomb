#ABSTRACT:
RNA viruses are present in a single host as a population of different
but related strains. This population, shaped by the combination of
genetic change and selection, is called quasispecies. Genetic change
is due to both point mutations and recombination events. We present a
jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral
quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next
generation sequencing data. The model introduces position-specific
probability tables over the sequence alphabet to explain the diversity
that can be found in the population at each site. Recombination events
are indicated by a change of state, allowing a single observed read to
originate from multiple sequences. We present an implementation of the
EM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model
parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains
in the quasispecies. The model is validated on simulated data, showing
the advantage of explicitly taking the recombination process into
account, and tested by applying to reads obtained from experimental 
HIV samples.

#CONTENT:
